1. ASKED CHAT GPT: "something in the code had a comment that it needed to be updated- where was that?"

Good catch — during our earlier steps, there was likely a placeholder or a comment like:

js
Copy
Edit
git clone <your-repo-url>  // <-- Update this with the actual repo URL

Or in other places like:

js
Copy
Edit
app.listen(8000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:8000"); // TODO: make port configurable
});

ME: "it had to do with passwords"

Ah — that jogs the memory. You're likely thinking of a TODO or warning comment in the backend authentication logic — specifically in the code using Passport.js or bcrypt, probably where user registration or password checking occurs.
Why It Was There
This type of TODO usually flags:

Weak error messages (res.status(500) with no details)

Lack of secure logging (not logging failed attempts or logging plaintext)

Incomplete error handling (e.g., user already exists)


The actual issue:
app.use(session({
  secret: 'replace-this-secret',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false
}));

Info given after specifically asking:
The secret here is used to sign session cookies, and using a hardcoded placeholder like 'replace-this-secret' is a security risk.
What You Should Do
Instead of hardcoding, pull it from an environment variable:

js
Copy
Edit
app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'default-dev-secret',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false
}));
Then in your .env file (not committed to GitHub):

arduino
Copy
Edit
SESSION_SECRET=something-long-and-random
And make sure to load .env at the top of your server.js:

js
Copy
Edit
require('dotenv').config();


2. CHATGPT suggested a .env and .gitignore way late in the process
